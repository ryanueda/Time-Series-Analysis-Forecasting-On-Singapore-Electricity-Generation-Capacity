# Time-Series-Analysis-Forecasting-On-Singapore-Electricity-Generation-Capacity
Applications Of Multiple Machine Learning Time Series Techniques On Singapore's Electricity Generation Capacity Over The Years

## About The Project
The project aims to make use of various time series analysis techniques in sklearn to decompose and analyse time series data, as well as create forecasts based off historical data. The dataset consists of information regarding Singapore's Electricity Generation Capacity over the years.

This includes and is not limited to :

- Exploratory Data Analysis & Time Series Decomposition
- Data Preprocessing & Wrangling
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
